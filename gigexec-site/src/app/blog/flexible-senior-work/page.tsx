                The future of work is evolving, and it's time to rethink how we approach senior talent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The traditional 9-to-5 work structure is no longer the only way forward.

              <p>
                As more professionals hit their 40s, 50s, and beyond, a flexible work model is not just desirable—it's essential.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">The Vision: Flexible Work for Senior Professionals</h2>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  Here's the vision: Full-time employment will remain the standard for younger workers until their mid-to-late 30s. After that? It's time to transition to flexible work models—freelancing, short-term contracts, independent consulting, and project-based roles. This approach offers senior professionals the opportunity to work on their own terms, creating a work-life balance that truly fits.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  The best part? By offering senior-level expertise in flexible formats, companies can access high-caliber talent without long-term commitments.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  Senior professionals can continue their careers with meaningful work, and businesses can gain the expertise they need without breaking the bank. It's a true win-win.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Why Flexible Work Models Are the Future for Senior Professionals</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 mb-6">
                  <li>
                    <strong>More Freelance Opportunities, Less Hassle:</strong> Enables businesses to hire senior professionals without full-time overhead. Opens more opportunities for experienced talent and removes the "we can't afford that expertise" excuse.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Smarter, Leaner Businesses:</strong> "Just-in-time" hiring provides needed expertise without long-term costs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Age Is Just a Number:</strong> Seniors have experience and can work on their terms well into later years. It's about expertise, not age.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Preparing for the Future:</strong> Flexible work helps professionals adapt to tech, economic, and automation changes.

                  <li><strong>Navigating Tax Laws and Regulations:</strong> Modern laws needed to support freelancers and prevent misclassification.</li>
                  <li><strong>Uncertainty with Short-Term Contracts:</strong> Frameworks needed for security and confidence in short-term roles.</li>
                  <li><strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> Education is needed to overcome skepticism about flexible work models.</li>
